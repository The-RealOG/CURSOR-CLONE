# Cursor IDE Redesign - HCI Project

## Project Overview

This project represents a comprehensive redesign of the Cursor IDE, developed as part of an HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) class. Through rigorous needfinding, prototyping, and user testing methodologies, we identified and addressed critical usability gaps that hinder Cursor's potential as an AI peer-programmer tool.

## Research Objectives

Our research focused on improving three core areas:
- **AI Collaboration**: Enhancing the interaction between developers and AI assistants
- **Version Control**: Streamlining git workflows and commit management
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Optimizing the developer experience for productivity

## Design Process

### 1. Needfinding
Through user interviews, surveys, and observational studies, we identified key pain points in the current Cursor IDE experience:
- Unclear AI suggestion workflows
- Inefficient file management systems
- Poor integration of version control features
- Lack of contextual code assistance

### 2. Prototyping
We developed a fully functional prototype that addresses these issues through:
- **Intelligent Code Suggestions**: Context-aware algorithm recommendations (linear ‚Üí binary search optimization)
- **Streamlined UI**: Clean, Fluent UI-based interface with improved navigation
- **Enhanced File Management**: Dynamic file creation and organization
- **Integrated Version Control**: Simplified commit workflows with visual history

### 3. User Testing
The prototype underwent extensive user testing to validate design decisions and iterate on user feedback.

## AI Strategy & Real-Time Features

### Multi-LLM Integration Philosophy
Our production system will implement a sophisticated AI orchestration layer that mirrors Cursor's approach while enhancing it with intelligent model selection:

#### Dynamic Model Switching
- **User Choice**: Manual model selection via dropdown (GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini Pro, etc.)
- **Automatic Optimization**: AI router selects optimal model based on:
  - Task complexity and type
  - Response time requirements  
  - Cost efficiency
  - Model availability and load
  - Historical performance data

- **Smart Model Selection**: Automatic routing based on task complexity, context size, and user preferences
- **Streaming Architecture**: Real-time response delivery for immediate user feedback
- **Performance Optimization**: Intelligent caching and load distribution across models

#### Balanced Multi-Model Usage
- **Round-Robin with Weights**: Distribute load across models based on performance
- **Cost Optimization**: Route expensive queries to cost-effective models when possible
- **Fallback Systems**: Automatic failover if primary model is unavailable
- **Caching Layer**: Redis-based response caching for repeated queries

### Real-Time Collaboration
- **WebSocket Architecture**: Live multi-user editing with instant synchronization
- **Shared AI Sessions**: Collaborative AI assistance where team members see real-time suggestions
